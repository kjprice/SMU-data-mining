    "The United States constitution requires a decennial census.   The census provides a headcount which does not provide enough details to make data driven decisions about the distribution of government funds.  A long form census with necessary details was introduced in the 20th century.   Only one in six households received the additional questions on the long form.  In the 21st century, the American Community Survey (ACS) was established to conduct ongoing surveys with the details previously included on the decennial long form census.   The ACS survey results provide data to determine the appropriate distribution of more than $400 billion in federal and state funds.  The funds are for social programs as well as physical and service infrastructure.  Annually 3.5 million homes are surveyed for the ACS.   \n",

    "Data from the 2013 ACS is available.  The data is segmented into housing data which applies to the entire household and personal data which provides detailed data for all individuals living in the household surveyed.  The household and personal data are independent.   No attempt was made to consolidate the files on this exploration of the data.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the size of the files and the number of attributes, the focus was on the 2.5% random sample of the personal data.  The personal data sample contains over seventy thousand (78,320) records with 283 attributes.  The descriptions of all attributes is contained in the data dictionary from the US Census Bureau.\n",
